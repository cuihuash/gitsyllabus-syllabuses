<p>This course will provide students with a foundation in cellular and molecular biology. Topics will include chemical principles, metabolism, cell architecture, patterns of inheritance, cellular reproduction, and a reintroduction to evolution, particularly how it relates to and is supported by the central dogma of biology. While the scope of this course is broad, it will have a concentrated focus on metabolic and genetic principles. A full year of introductory chemistry is highly recommended, students wishing to take CHEM 114 concurrently with BIOL 213 are advised that it will be extremely rigorous. Remaining molecular subjects will be distributed in the remaining time-frame for the course.</p>

<h2>Test Questions</h2>

<p>Exams will consist primarily of problem solving questions related to the material, memory of basic concepts relating to biochemistry, and application of the material learned in class to unique problems. Questions are designed to test a student’s knowledge and understanding of the material. Biology has its own set of vocabulary; therefore some topics will require rote memorization. However, I expect the student to apply the techniques and concepts learned in class toward a new problem. I will be doing a lot of homework in class this semester to get you up to speed on your basic skills.</p>

<h2>How to do well in this class</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Come to class:</strong> Simple enough, really. While I make it a point to not ask many questions out of the textbook on material I haven’t covered in the lectures, it is quite common for me to write questions based on class material that appears nowhere in the textbook.</li>
<li><strong>Read the assignments before class:</strong> As I will explain in class, 5% of your grade will come from class preparation, namely an outline of the reading assignment. Furthermore, if you read ahead of time, you might be hearing concepts for the second or third time, instead of the first, which would probably help with your understanding of the material.</li>
<li><strong>Take good notes:</strong> I purposefully use a teaching style heavy on “chalk talk” in order to control the pace of the class. That way there is time for questions or diversions, as the class needs. However, if you are only writing in your notes what I write on the board, you aren’t writing enough.</li>
<li><strong>Do the homework:</strong> I will assign homework regularly from the back of the chapters as study help, and will hand out problems similar to the kind I will ask on the exams. You will get time in class to work on the problems together, but most assignments will also require work outside of class. Most of the time the homework will be graded on the effort you put into it, not necessarily if you got the right answer.</li>
<li><strong>Review your notes on a daily basis:</strong> I have had students tell me “Oh man, I stayed up all night studying for this test!” Really? How’d that work out for you? Wouldn’t it have been easier to spread those 12 hours out over the last 3 weeks?</li>
<li><strong>If something isn’t clear, ask a question:</strong> I have small children at home (a 6 year old and two 3 year olds). So I am quite used to people pretending not to hear what I say. Repeatedly. It is a refreshing change of pace when someone asks me to repeat something for a reason better articulated than “Huh?” “What?” “La-la-la-la-la-la.” If I say something that is unclear or contradicts the textbook… please say so!</li>
<li><strong>Utilize the Student Learning Center:</strong> Many of the tutors have had me in class, and in some cases have worked in my research lab. They know what I expect, and what kind of expectations I have for my students.</li>
<li>Please don’t ask what your grade is, then walk away: If all you care about is the grade you get, why should I care about anything else, either?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Attendance</h2>

<p>Attendance in class is mandatory, as the material covered builds on previously discussed information. Please do not expect to be able to put off your reading for three weeks and magically understand everything in one crash study session. I will not provide daily handouts for a missed class without a formal excuse. There are always legitimate excuses for missing class, however, the definition of “legitimate” is at my discretion. If you miss class because of a family emergency, illness, etc, please report it to Student Services, and they will let me know.</p>

<h2>Odds and Ends</h2>

<ul>
<li>Assignments are due when asked for in class on the assigned day. Anything else is considered late. The standard late penalty for assignments is 10% deduction per day. Assignments submitted over 1 week late WILL NOT be graded.</li>
<li>There will be NO make-up quizzes after the fact. You can drop your lowest quiz grade.</li>
<li>Plagiarism of any kind will not be tolerated. The first offense is grounds for failing the assignment (with zero credit). The second offense is grounds for failing the class. Any offense will be reported to the Academic Integrity Officer.</li>
<li>There will be no make-up examinations for an unexcused absence. Your holiday travel plans do not qualify as a proper excuse.</li>
<li>No answering or making calls during class.</li>
<li>No text messaging or IM’ing during class</li>
</ul>
